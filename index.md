### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    The entirety of lab 3 was a personal favorite because this was the first lab that required me to code. The lab required user input in order for the code to properly work and when it did, it gave me that feeling of satisfaction that I could succeed in this major. I previously had no prior experience with coding so to see the code work, was something very memorable. 

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was also another favorite because we coded our first image. It was a nice change of pace, and really, an experience that taught me that coding is so much more than I thought it was. I never would have thought that we were able to code color, and I'm excited to learn more features in the future.   

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was a favorite because it was one of the more difficult ones for me. I've never played blackjack before this, so it was really cool experience learning it in this lab. On top of that, I gained a better understanding of using multiple else-if statements.
